# VBA-challenge-Module 2 Challenge
Goal: To write VBA code to analyze generated stock market data.

The task was to create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for a given year and outputs the ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume. In addition, the script returns the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.

The script is modified to run on every worksheet for each year at once.
